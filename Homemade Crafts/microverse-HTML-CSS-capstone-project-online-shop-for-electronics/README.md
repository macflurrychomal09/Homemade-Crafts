# Online shop (index and search page) - Built time 16 hours

> This is a capstone/exam project for the [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org) module HTML/CSS. It is a Crafts(handmades) website using HTML, CSS3/SCSS, Bootstrap, and Font awesome.

## Watch a video presentation of the project [here](https://www.loom.com/share/1ecb819a678e4b3f8681da87415597cf). The website is built using this [mockup](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX)

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS3/SCSS
